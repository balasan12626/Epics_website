## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A calm blue (#5DADE2) to evoke a sense of trust and health monitoring. This will be used for key interactive elements.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F7FA) to provide a clean and modern look, ensuring readability and focus on the data presented.
- Accent color: Soft green (#A3E4D7) to highlight important notifications and status indicators, signaling positive or normal states. Avoid using this color where the intention is to highlight urgent needs. (#E25D69 may be a good contrasting color instead.)
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, objective, and neutral look. The font provides excellent readability and works well for both headlines and body text.
- Note: currently only Google Fonts are supported.
- Use consistent and clean icons to represent different data points and functionalities. Icons should be easily understandable at a glance.
- Implement a responsive grid layout to ensure the dashboard is accessible and functional across different devices. Use clear visual hierarchy to prioritize information.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions and data updates, enhancing the overall user experience without being distracting.
